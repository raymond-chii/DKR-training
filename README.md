# DKR Training Repository

## Welcome to the DKR Training Repository!

This repository contains the code and documentation related to the training program where we focused on operating an ABB industrial robot to pick up and drop boxes accurately using loops.

## Introduction

The main objective of this training was to familiarize ourselves with the operation of an ABB industrial robot and develop the necessary skills to control its movements for picking up and dropping objects. We started by using for loops to control the robot's actions with two boxes and gradually progressed to operating four boxes.

## ABB Industrial Robot

The ABB industrial robot is a highly versatile and efficient machine used in various industrial applications. It provides precise control over its movements and enables automation of complex tasks. In our training, we specifically worked with the ABB industrial robot to practice the pick and drop operations.
